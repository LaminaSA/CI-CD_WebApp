### Introduction to Flask
---

Flask is a lightweight, micro web development framework for Python. Compared to the higher-level frameworks, it’s much more flexible and, best of all, it doesn’t get in your way as you’re building out your web site. You can add complexity as your application grows. It’s great for beginners who want to better understand the shortcuts that larger, high-level web frameworks employ.
